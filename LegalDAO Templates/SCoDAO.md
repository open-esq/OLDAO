(iii) *Determination of Exception Handling*:

(A) The term “***Exception Handling Addendum***” refers to an addendum to this Agreement signed by the Parties and setting forth the Parties’ agreement on the existence or non-existence of a Material Adverse Exception Event and the actions to be taken, the agreements to be entered into, and the remedies to be sought in response thereto.

If the Parties agree upon such matters during the Negotiation Period, the Parties shall promptly enter into an Exception Handling Addendum reflecting the same.
